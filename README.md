## Brief discription about the ps
In this world of big data, Trell wants you to use the data to predict the age group of their users based on their activity on social media activities.  This will help them to divide their huge userbase and cater differently to each of them. Given this huge dataset, predict the age group of the users, the evaluation metric for the competition is the Weighted F1 score.
